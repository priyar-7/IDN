What is IDN?

IdentityNow = A cloud system that manages and controls access for all employees.

  “IdentityNow is a cloud-based SaaS Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) platform 
   that manages user identities, automates provisioning, and ensures secure access across applications.”

✅ IdentityNow (IDN) is a cloud-based SaaS.

Here’s the simplest meaning:

Cloud-based → It runs on the cloud (no servers needed).

SaaS (Software as a Service) → You just use it like a service; SailPoint manages all backend, servers, upgrades, patches.

📌 So IDN = Cloud-based SaaS platform for

Managing user identities

Managing access

Automated provisioning

Governance (reviews, certifications)



Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)
✅ IGA = Identity Governance + Identity Administration
It is a complete system used by companies to manage user identities and control access safely.

1️⃣ Identity Administration (IA) – Operational Work
This is day-to-day identity management, like:


Creating user accounts

Updating user details

Assigning access

Removing access

Password resets


Example:
New employee joins → system creates AD account + email.

2️⃣ Identity Governance (IG) – Control & Compliance
This ensures access is correct, safe, and audited, like:


Approvals


Access reviews


Certifications


Policy checks (SoD)


Removing unnecessary access


Example:
Manager reviews who has access to Salesforce and removes extra access.

In simple words:
IGA = Managing accounts + Making sure access is correct.
